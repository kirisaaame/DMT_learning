What are CVS builds?
---------------------------
CVS builds are versions of dosbox.exe that people have built from the latest version of the DOSBox source code,
which is stored on sourceforge.net in something called a CVS repository. CVS builds contain changes that have been
made by Qbix and Harekiet since the latest official release.
Some enhanced CVS builds also contain unofficial features and fixes that have been created by enthusiasts in the
DOSBox development community.
